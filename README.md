## AI as a Microservice for Smart Edge of Things
___
In comparison to monolithic solutions, distributed computing and AI processing at the edge with microservices has been found to be an effective way to deliver real-time IoT services and applications. In comparison to conventional IoT solutions, these solutions are anticipated to assist the construction of smart services at the edge, autonomous decision-making, and IoT applications that are delay-sensitive. In this project, we are trying to address and give solutions to several key factors such as monitoring. provisioning and utilization of resources, workload distribution, decentralized resource chaining and scheduling while focusing mainly on enhancing security and privacy using blockchain technology.
